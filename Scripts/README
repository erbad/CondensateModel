Summary of scripts, date and modifications

11/03/25
Density.py

Script that works even in case in which there is a small droplet.
Fixed the indices selection that gave problem. Integration of histo
gives the number of C in the system. It splits the simulation in three
parts of 1000 frames each and fits the data of each part. Fitting params
are saved in output file.
With slight modifications, it can be adapted for different situations
(RNA mix, competitor...).

12/03/25
Occupancy.py
Computes average occupancy of chains. Requires indeces of single chains 
and the pairdist file created with gromacs as written at the beginning of the script.

MakeIndexSingleChains.py
Creates indeces file and attach it to the existent one.
