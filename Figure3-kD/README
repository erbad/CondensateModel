List of what is inside:

10/3/25 
- ePP-Perc-kD.dat
  Raw data of kDs from simulations:
  * at 50uM of concentration, 
  * 2.5us long
  * ePR=14 
  Sigma is set to 1.5nm and energetic cutoff is used to consider bound state.
  Thus, cutoff distance is:
  r_co = 1/pi * arccos(4/eps - 1)
  where eps is the unit of KT for ePR.
  For ePR=14, r_co = 0.7532 sigma.

- ePR-ePP-rep-PercBound-A10.dat
  Same as before but for A10+10B simulations. 7 replicas of 1us for each ePP.

- PlotKD.ipynb
  Notebook to plot kD pictures as in YRS in March 7.
